Question:
The given table 'students' contains the total marks of a student in a class. 
The teacher of the class wants to assign grades to the students with the following logic:
	Greater > 90 | A+
	Greater > 70 | A
	Greater > 50 | B
	Greater >= 40 | C
	Less than 40 | Fail
Write an SQL query to achieve the same. Return ID, name, marks, grade for each student.

Answer : 

SELECT id, name, marks,
CASE
    WHEN marks > 90 THEN 'A+'
    WHEN marks > 70 AND marks <= 90 THEN 'A'
    WHEN marks > 50 AND marks <= 70 THEN 'B'
    WHEN marks >= 40 AND marks <= 50 THEN 'C'
    ELSE 'FAIL'
    END AS grade
FROM students;
